            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>A lot of students find it hard to find good but free revision materials<br>
  for the specific subjects/topics they need. The resources that are already<br>
  available are often scattered across multiple websites, are low quality<br>
  or locked behind paywalls.<br><br>
  This makes studying harder than it has to be especially for students<br>
  who dont want to pay for resources.</p>
